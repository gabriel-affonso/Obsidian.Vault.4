for men and 23.6 minutes for  
women. In general, a higher pro-  
portion of women than men made  
shorter commutes, particularly for  
trips that took from 5 to 24 min-  
utes. Nearly equal proportions of  
men and women commuted  
between 25 and 29 minutes to  
work. For trips of 30 minutes or  
more, the proportion in each cate-  
gory was higher for men than  
women. The proportion working  
at home was also higher for men  
than for women: 3.7 percent com-  
pared with 2.9 percent. However,  
of the 4.2 million who worked at  
home, approximately 53 percent  
were women.  
In 2000, about 53 percent  
of workers departed between  
6:30 a.m. and 8:29 a.m. to  
go to work.  
Table 3 shows the time period in  
which workers left home to go to  
work. The peak period was from  
6:30 a.m. to 8:29 a.m., covering  
55 percent of workers in 1990 and  
53 percent in 2000. During the  
decade, the number departing from  
12 midnight to 6:29 a.m. rose by  
nearly 4.8 million people, and  
increased from 18 percent to  
20 percent of the total. Small  
changes occurred in the percentage  
of workers who left for work  
among the categories between  
8:30 a.m. and 3:59 p.m.  
Additionally, the percentage did not  
show any statistical evidence of a  
change for those who departed  
between 4:00 p.m. and 11:59 p.m.  
Fewer people worked in  
central cities than elsewhere  
in metropolitan areas in 2000.  
Table 4 presents data on commut-  
ing patterns by place of residence  
and by place of work among central  
cities, the remainder of metropoli-  
tan areas (outside central cities),  
and nonmetropolitan areas for 1990  
and 2000. The number of workers
