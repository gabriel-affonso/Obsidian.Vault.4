Hoje houveram atualizações nas páginas relativas à call JUST-2025-JTRA e JUST-2025-JCOO. 

A pergunta "Under CERV and Justice Programmes, is attention to children’s rights affecting my proposal’s performance in the evaluation?" foi feita a ambas. 

A resposta foi:
"The evaluation methodology (evaluation criteria for relevance, quality and impact) is designed to reflect “Rights of the child/Child protection policies” dimension. Consequently, (lack of) attention to rights of a child/child protection policies dimension may have an impact on the score a proposal receives in the evaluation.

Notably, if a project has a direct or indirect impact on children and their rights, the project should address children as rights holders and should ensure their participation in the design and implementation of the project."

escreva um email institucional para a International Sociological Association Diga para eles que eu acredito ter encontrado um erro no site do Research Committee 12- Sociology of Law.  https://www.isa-sociology.org/en/research-networks/research-committees/rc12-sociology-of-law/ diga que ao clicar no link relativo à Canadian Law and Society Association sou direcionado ao site https://www.deepsouthdivers.org/, que aparenta ser um site de apostas indonésio.
