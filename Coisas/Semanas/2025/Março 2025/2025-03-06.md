ESTOU COM ALGUMA DIFICULDADE DE ESCREVER ESTE TEXTO. QUERO QUE VOCÊ REESCREVA ESTE PARÁGRAFO EM INGLÊS TENDO EM CONTA AS ORIENTAÇÕES QUE SEGUEM ABAIXO.  
  
ORIENTAÇÕES:

ATUALMENTE FERRAMENTAS DE VIDEO CONFERÊNCIA ESTÃO MUITO MAIS PRESENTES NOS SISTEMAS DE JUSTIÇA DA EUROPA. POR OUTRO LADO, O USO DE FERRAMENTAS BASEADAS EM IA AINDA É LIMITADO.

APESAR DISTO, AO ANALISAR A OFERTA EUROPEIA DE FORMAÇÃO JUDICIAL, FICA EVIDENTE QUE TÓPICOS RELACIONADOS À IA, SEUS DESAFIOS E SUAS FERRAMENTAS ESTÃO MUITO MAIS PRESENTES. POR ISTO, O PRINICPAL CONTRIBUTO E INOVAÇÃO DO PROJETO TOOLS4COOP É PREENCHER ESTA LACUNA NA FORMAÇÃO. ESTE PROJETO PORTANTO, NÃO PRETENDE CONTESTAR O PAPEL QUE A IA VAI DESEMPENHAR NO FUTURO DA JUSTIÇA, MAS SIMPLESMENTE RECONHECER O PAPEL QUE O USO DE FERRAMENTAS JÁ DESEMPENHA NOS SISTEMAS DE JUSTIÇA NA UE E A NECESSIDADE DE FORMAR ATORES JUDICIAS PARA UTILIZADOS DE MANEIRA RESPONSÁVEL E UNIFORMIZADA.  
  

PARÁGRAFO:

However, the Tools4COOP, more than simply continue the efforts on the improvement of cross-border justice by the digitalization, aims to fill the current gaps on previous projects. As mentioned in the previously referred training needs assessment, this project has found a disparity between identified judicial training demands and current judicial training offers by European institutions and projects. According to the training need assessment of this project themes related to the uses and challenges of Artificial Intelligence are significantly more abordados than training on the use of video conference tools. Undoubtedly IA tools are playing a growing role in judicial institutions, and will become a part of the courts around the globe. However, as demonstrated by the 2024 Justice Scoreboard, the carrying out of judicial procedures by video conferences is already by all Member States in some degree. Meanwhile, only six use AI-based applications in core activities.

However, Tools4COOP does not merely seek to continue efforts to enhance cross-border justice through digitalization; its primary objective is to address existing gaps in previous projects. As highlighted in the project's judicial training needs assessment, a significant disparity exists between the identified training demands and the current offerings provided by European institutions and initiatives. Notably, topics related to the use and challenges of Artificial Intelligence (AI) are increasingly prevalent in judicial training programs, whereas training on video conferencing tools remains comparatively limited. While AI tools are expected to play an expanding role in judicial institutions and will likely become an integral part of courts worldwide, the 2024 Justice Scoreboard demonstrates that all EU Member States already employ video conferencing to some extent in judicial procedures. However, only six Member States currently use AI-based applications in core judicial activities. Tools4COOP, therefore, aims to bridge this gap in judicial training, ensuring that legal professionals are equipped to use these technologies responsibly and consistently.
