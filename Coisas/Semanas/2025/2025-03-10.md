Estou escrevendo uma candidatura para finaciamento da comissão europeia para um projeto de treinamento professional. Quero sua ajuda para escrever a secção “Consortium Management and decision-making”. As orientações para esta secção são: “Explain the management structures and decision-making mechanisms within the consortium. Describe how decisions will be taken and how regular and effective communication will be ensured. Describe methods to ensure planning and control.

Note: The concept (including organisational structure and decision-making mechanisms) must be adapted to the complexity and scale of the project”.

Abaixo segue o texto que escrevi até agora. Quero que você reescre-va o para que ele se aproxime da orientações para o campo e de acordo com o contexto de candidaturas para financiamento para a Comissão Europeia.

TEXTO:

To guarantee the project's high-quality execution and timely completion, a steering committee, which includes one representative from each of the (INSERIR NÚMERO DE PAÍSES DO CONSÓRCIO) project partners, will organize monthly meetings. At the end of each meeting, minutes will be drafted with clear delegations and timelines for the tasks to be completed.

These meetings are essential to coordinate and manage project implementation and all activities planned (including administrative and financial management); to ensure the project activities are carried out (the procedures for the organisation of the activities will be discussed by all partners, in order to create synergies and share experiences that may be helpful and improve efficiency); to guarantee the project progresses and observes the timetable; to monitor and evaluate the implementation of the project activities; to create strategies to manage risks; to comply with ethical standards and report regularly to the European Commission.

CES is the coordinating entity, responsible for ensuring efficient coordination, monitoring the project implementation, by elaborating the midterm and final reports, as well as continuous communication among partners. All partners have a national project coordinator who will be responsible for the activities in their respective country, for the overall organisational and financial management in their country, and for ensuring that the obligations and responsibilities towards the European Commission are met by the consortium. Decisions that have an impact on the overall objectives of the project will be made by a majority vote among all partners. In case of disagreement between the partners, the Project Coordinator (INSERIR COORDENADOR, CES) is responsible for mediating and resolving all issues in line with the procedures described in the Consortium Agreement.

From a methodological standpoint, Tools4COOP will apply two frameworks for project management. The so-called Deming's cycle (PDCA), which is a set of four repetitive steps that aid in continuous quality improvement and learning, articulated in four linked steps: plan, do, check, act. And the Kanban system, a dynamic tool to track the development of tasks in an organized manner, dividing the workflow into three basic columns: "to do", "in progress", "done". This representation holds stakeholders accountable and immediately highlights areas for intervention.

To ensure the quality of the project, monitor its development, and evaluate its strategy, a body composed of three external professionals will be created: the Scientific Advisory Committee – henceforth referred to as SAC. The SAC will include 6 scholars and professionals in the field of justice, renowned at the international level and will carry out the following activities: verify the project's progress status; provide information about the legal and cultural context of different involved countries; validate the methodological choices; evaluate the preliminary results of the project; evaluate project's recipients satisfactions; actively support the engagement of professionals in different involved countries; actively support the dissemination of the project’s results.
