Estou escrevendo uma candidatura para finaciamento da comissão europeia para um projeto de treinamento professional. Quero sua ajuda para escrever a secção “Consortium Management and decision-making”. As orientações para esta secção são: “Explain the management structures and decision-making mechanisms within the consortium. Describe how decisions will be taken and how regular and effective communication will be ensured. Describe methods to ensure planning and control.

Note: The concept (including organisational structure and decision-making mechanisms) must be adapted to the complexity and scale of the project”.

Abaixo segue o texto que escrevi até agora. Quero que você reescre-va o para que ele se aproxime da orientações para o campo e de acordo com o contexto de candidaturas para financiamento para a Comissão Europeia.

TEXTO:

To guarantee the project's high-quality execution and timely completion, a steering committee, which includes one representative from each of the (INSERIR NÚMERO DE PAÍSES DO CONSÓRCIO) project partners, will organize monthly meetings. At the end of each meeting, minutes will be drafted with clear delegations and timelines for the tasks to be completed.

These meetings are essential to coordinate and manage project implementation and all activities planned (including administrative and financial management); to ensure the project activities are carried out (the procedures for the organisation of the activities will be discussed by all partners, in order to create synergies and share experiences that may be helpful and improve efficiency); to guarantee the project progresses and observes the timetable; to monitor and evaluate the implementation of the project activities; to create strategies to manage risks; to comply with ethical standards and report regularly to the European Commission.

CES is the coordinating entity, responsible for ensuring efficient coordination, monitoring the project implementation, by elaborating the midterm and final reports, as well as continuous communication among partners. All partners have a national project coordinator who will be responsible for the activities in their respective country, for the overall organisational and financial management in their country, and for ensuring that the obligations and responsibilities towards the European Commission are met by the consortium. Decisions that have an impact on the overall objectives of the project will be made by a majority vote among all partners. In case of disagreement between the partners, the Project Coordinator (INSERIR COORDENADOR, CES) is responsible for mediating and resolving all issues in line with the procedures described in the Consortium Agreement.

From a methodological standpoint, Tools4COOP will apply two frameworks for project management. The so-called Deming's cycle (PDCA), which is a set of four repetitive steps that aid in continuous quality improvement and learning, articulated in four linked steps: plan, do, check, act. And the Kanban system, a dynamic tool to track the development of tasks in an organized manner, dividing the workflow into three basic columns: "to do", "in progress", "done". This representation holds stakeholders accountable and immediately highlights areas for intervention.

To ensure the quality of the project, monitor its development, and evaluate its strategy, a body composed of three external professionals will be created: the Scientific Advisory Committee – henceforth referred to as SAC. The SAC will include 6 scholars and professionals in the field of justice, renowned at the international level and will carry out the following activities: verify the project's progress status; provide information about the legal and cultural context of different involved countries; validate the methodological choices; evaluate the preliminary results of the project; evaluate project's recipients satisfactions; actively support the engagement of professionals in different involved countries; actively support the dissemination of the project’s results.

Consortium Management and Decision-Making

To ensure the efficient and high-quality implementation of the project, a Steering Committee (SC) will be established, composed of one representative from each of the [INSERIR NÚMERO DE PAÍSES DO CONSÓRCIO] partner institutions. The SC will convene monthly to oversee project execution, address strategic issues, and ensure alignment with the project’s objectives. Meeting minutes will be systematically documented, including clear action points, responsibilities, and deadlines, to facilitate accountability and continuous monitoring.

Management Structures and Responsibilities

The Center for European Studies (CES) will serve as the coordinating entity, ensuring seamless project execution, financial oversight, and compliance with the European Commission’s requirements. The national project coordinators, designated by each partner, will oversee local implementation, ensuring that activities, administrative procedures, and financial management align with the consortium’s agreed framework.

To enhance operational efficiency, a multi-tiered governance structure will be adopted:

1. Steering Committee (SC) – Responsible for overall strategic coordination, major decision-making, and risk management. Decisions impacting project goals will be made by majority vote.


2. Project Coordination Team (PCT) – Led by [INSERIR COORDENADOR, CES], responsible for daily project management, financial oversight, and reporting to the European Commission. In case of disputes, the PCT will mediate conflicts based on procedures outlined in the Consortium Agreement.


3. National Project Coordinators (NPCs) – Manage country-specific activities, ensuring compliance with national regulations and facilitating stakeholder engagement.


4. Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) – An independent body composed of six internationally renowned scholars and professionals in the field of justice. The SAC will provide methodological guidance, review project progress, validate legal and cultural considerations, and assess the impact of the training activities.



Decision-Making Mechanisms and Conflict Resolution

The decision-making process is structured to ensure inclusivity, transparency, and efficiency. The SC will adopt a consensus-based approach, with decisions requiring a simple majority vote. In the event of a deadlock or disputes among partners, the Project Coordinator (CES) will mediate the resolution, ensuring alignment with the project’s objectives and compliance with the Consortium Agreement.

Communication and Coordination Strategy

To facilitate regular and effective communication, the consortium will implement a multi-channel approach, ensuring smooth collaboration among all partners:

Monthly virtual SC meetings and biannual in-person consortium meetings to review progress and address strategic concerns.

Project management platform (e.g., Trello, Asana, or an EU-funded tool like SYGMA) to track deliverables, share documents, and streamline workflows.

Quarterly reports summarizing activities, financial status, and potential risks, ensuring continuous assessment and mitigation strategies.

Internal communication via dedicated Slack channels, email groups, and instant messaging platforms to facilitate real-time discussions.


Project Planning, Monitoring, and Control

To ensure effective planning, quality assurance, and risk management, the project will implement two complementary project management frameworks:

1. Deming’s Cycle (PDCA) – A structured four-step approach (Plan, Do, Check, Act) for continuous quality improvement, applied across all project phases.


2. Kanban System – A real-time workflow visualization tool that tracks task progression under three categories: "To Do," "In Progress," and "Completed". This method enhances transparency, facilitates accountability, and allows immediate intervention in case of bottlenecks.



The Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) will play a crucial role in quality assurance, conducting periodic evaluations to assess:

The effectiveness of training methodologies,

The impact of the project on target audiences,

The satisfaction levels of beneficiaries,

The engagement of professionals and stakeholders across participating countries.


Risk Management and Compliance

The consortium will implement a Risk Management Plan (RMP), which includes:

A risk register identifying potential operational, financial, and administrative risks,

Mitigation strategies to address emerging challenges,

Regular compliance reviews to ensure adherence to ethical standards and EU regulations,

Annual audits and external evaluations to enhance transparency and financial accountability.


By adopting this structured and scalable management approach, the project will ensure efficient decision-making, continuous quality improvement, and effective communication, ultimately maximizing the project’s impact and sustainability.
