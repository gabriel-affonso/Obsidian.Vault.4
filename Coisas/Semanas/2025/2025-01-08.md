	- [ ] From the Old Testament we have learned the necessity of punitive retribution; from the Gospels, that of mercy and redemption; on Roman law we have built the supporting structure of our codes; from Greek literature and philosophy we have learned the priority of formal editing even when it conflicts with our convictions. If Antigone places the àgrafoi nòmoi, the laws engraved in our hearts, before the imperatives of the tyrant, this does not mean that she evades the sanction that she faces with serenity. Socrates does the same, who, encouraged to escape by fleeing, repudiates such an expedient as an outrage to the authority of the Fatherland.
