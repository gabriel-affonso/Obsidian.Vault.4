The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of between EUR
3.00 and 3.50 million would allow these outcomes to be addressed
appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and
selection of a proposal requesting different amounts.
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 7.00 million.
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions
Legal and financial
set-up of the Grant
Agreements

The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions

Community (2021-2025). 38
.

Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
• EU and national decision makers, researchers, practitioners and media organisations are
equipped to deliver effective prevention and counter measures on radicalisation,
extremism, hate speech and polarisation, based on a better understanding of the drivers
and mechanisms of extremism, hate speech and polarisation, and by implementing
effective recommendations, tools, narratives, methodologies, and other solutions.
• Improved evidence-based policymaking to counter and prevent radicalisation,
extremism, hate speech and polarisation, based on experiments that apply the results of
previous research and innovation projects in a practical/educational real-life context,
allowing the replication of methods and recommendations for legislative changes or for
the translation of research findings into innovations.
• EU institutions and national policymakers gain insights into radicalisation, extremism,
and hate speech, including their impact on young people and how youth perceive and
engage with information on these phenomena, whether online or offline.
• EU institutions, national decision-makers, and civil society organisations acquire a
thorough understanding of the mechanisms driving successful extremist, radical, and
hate campaigns, as well as the diverse political environments and their modes of
interaction and communication, extending beyond social media and online platforms.
In addition, projects should contribute to at least one of the following expected outcomes:
• Improved understanding of methodologies to effectively map hate ecosystems online
through qualitative and quantitative tools, also with a view to supporting the
enforcement of existing laws prohibiting racist, xenophobic and misogynistic hate
speech, and to protect potential victims.
• Increased understanding of the link between disinformation and hate speech, and
radicalisation and extremism, in particular how disinformation and hate campaigns
deepen social divisions and create the conditions for radicalisation and extremism.
• Increased understanding of patterns of media consumption by individuals and their use
of traditional media vs social media to form their own opinion, the effects of a polarised

public sphere on the media landscape, including the role of journalists; and the possible
developments in the area of citizens’-led media content.
• Increased understanding of the role of traditional media, online media, social media, and
artificial intelligence in countering mis- and disinformation, hatred, and the spread of
narratives that drive radicalisation, polarisation, and extremism in societies.
• Improved tools and methods to assess the reliability of sources and related meta-tagging
systems to map different points of view, as well as other actionable journalistic practices
(e.g. forums, citizens’ engagement and outreach, communication channels with editorial
teams) which have proven effective in improving the quality of debate in the media.
• Increased availability of training tools, materials, and methods for educators and
educational organisations to engage with students, enhancing their capacity to provide
opportunities to raise awareness and counter hate, extremism and polarisation.
Scope: The phenomena of radicalisation, extremism, incitement to hatred and polarisation are
a growing threat to democracy and social cohesion. In recent years, the EU has adopted
several strategies to combat racism, antisemitism and xenophobia, as well as to counter hate
speech and hate crimes. The EU also has policy tools to respond to all forms of extremism
and radicalisation. As recalled by the Joint Communication “No Place for Hate” 39 of 6
December 2023, these initiatives are even more urgent considering the growth in hate speech
and crimes against women and minorities in recent years.

Social media amplifies radicalisation, extremism, hate speech, and polarisation. Algorithm-
driven personalisation restricts the public sphere and creates "echo chambers" where users

primarily engage with like-minded views. This confirmation bias intensifies polarisation,
fuels radicalisation, aids in recruiting extremists, and promotes hate speech and crime.
Confirmation bias influences both social and traditional media users, as individuals seek
information aligning with their beliefs. This trend impacts public discourse, fostering
misinformation and disinformation including conspiracy theories by limiting exposure to
diverse viewpoints and distorting perception of reality.
These phenomena arise from distortions in online interactions and media outlet
characteristics, especially those that are mostly if not solely disseminated online. In certain
member states, online media have replaced traditional media channels (TV, radio, press) as
the main information source, lacking transparency regarding affiliations with interest groups
or foreign influences.
Moreover, radicalization and polarisation spread through social networks beyond social
media. Therefore, proposals should also consider offline social networks, which include
relationships like friendships, kinships, and shared interests, not solely reliant on online
platforms.

Research activities should involve a wide range of stakeholders and potential end-users,
including non-scientific and non-academic actors, such as, but not limited to public bodies,
media organisations and outlets, journalists, social media platforms, and representatives from
other social networks, non-governmental organisations, civil society organisations,
policymakers, educational bodies, other potential end-users of the research results. The
involvement of these categories of stakeholders is required to test and uptake the research
results and to explore their readiness to be implemented and replicated. More specifically,
research activities are encouraged to involve online services which are signatories of entities
which are subject to the Digital Services Act (DSA), as their involvement is required to
provide researchers with access to data necessary to undertake research and access to platform
data on the spread and behaviour of disinformation on the large online platforms.
Proposals are encouraged to explore the following themes (among others): radicalisation and
polarisation driven by stereotypes related to gender, religion, or ethnic minorities; the impact
of new technologies on the production and dissemination of radicalisation and extremist
content; the role of social cohesion, as both radicalisation and democratic participation are
significantly influenced by the level of social cohesion within society.
Proposals are encouraged to include historical and comparative analysis, which is crucial for
understanding the past uses of hate speech as well as contemporary efforts by radical and
extremist organisations to shape narratives. By contextualising these dynamics, proposals can
explore the evolution and impacts of these phenomena over time, providing insights into
effective strategies for combating them.
Proposals should collaborate with the EU Knowledge Hub on radicalisation prevention (RAN
– Radicalisation Awareness Networks) to align priorities and share outcomes and should
develop advisory services to its members.
Proposals are encouraged to seek collaboration whenever possible with relevant projects
selected under previous EU-funded calls, such as HORIZON-CL3-2022-FCT-01-03 -
Enhanced fight against the abuse of online gaming culture by extremists, or HORIZON-CL3-
2022-FCT-01-03 - Enhanced fight against the abuse of online gaming culture by extremists.
Clustering and cooperation with other selected projects under this topic and other relevant
projects are strongly encouraged.
Where applicable, proposals should leverage the data and services available through European
Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud, as well as data
from relevant Data Spaces. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced
in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).
