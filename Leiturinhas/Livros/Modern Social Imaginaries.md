p.1 Desde seu começo, o problema número 1 das ciencias sociais modernas é a modernidade em si. 

from the beginning, the number one problem of modern
social science has been modernity itself: that historically
unprecedented amalgam of new practices and institu-
tional forms (science, technology, industrial production,
urbanization), of new ways of living (individualism, secular-
ization, instrumental rationality); and of new forms of mal-
aise (alienation, meaninglessness, a sense of impending social
dissolution).

This book explores the hypothesis that we can throw some
light on both the original and the contemporary issues about
modernity if we can come to a clearer definition of the self-
understandings that have been constitutive of it. Western mo-
dernity on this view is inseparable from a certain kind of so-
cial imaginary, and the differences among today's multiple
modernities need to be understood in terms of the divergent
social imaginaries involved

> Ah, entendi. Existem poucas diferenças gerais no modo de produção entre as várias sociedades contemporâneas. Todas elas funcionam em termos de produção assalariada

This approach is not the same as one that might focus on
the "ideas," as against the "institutions," of modernity. The
social imaginary is not a set of ideas; rather, it is what enables,
through making sense of, the practices of a society.

My basic hypothesis is that central to Western modernity is a new conception of the moral order of society. The mutation of this view of moral
order into our social imaginary is the coming to be of certain social forms, which are those essentially characterizing Western modernity: the market economy, the public sphere, and the self-governing people, among others

But already with Locke, the political theory can justify
revolution, indeed, make revolution morally imperative in
certain circumstances; at the same time, other general fea-
tures of the human moral predicament provide a hermeneutic
of legitimacy in relation to, for instance, property. Later on
down the line, this notion of order will be woven into redac-
tions demanding even more revolutionary changes, including
in relations of property, as reflected in influential theories
such as those of Rousseau and Marx, for instance.
