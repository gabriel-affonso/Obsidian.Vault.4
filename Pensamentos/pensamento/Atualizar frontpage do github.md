### About

I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in European Institutions, Politics and Policy at University College London.

In the past, I worked as a researcher at universities in Sweden and Belgium and as a political advisor in the European Parliament.

### Research

My research tends to focus on European integration, judicial politics, and Central and Eastern Europe. Sometimes the intersection of all three. [See my academic publications.](https://michalovadek.github.io/publications.html)

Methodologically, I try to keep up with developments in statistics, especially quantitative text analysis ("artificial intelligence").

### Teaching

At UCL, I teach courses related to European integration, quantitative research methods, and judicial politics.

For a number of years I have been organizing workshops introducing doctoral students in law and humanities to data science.
